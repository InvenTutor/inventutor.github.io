:::tip Note
We believe that everyone should have access to awesome software for free, so we will never restrict basic features behind a subscription paywall. The subscription only unlocks unnecessary features that enhance the user experience.

## Concerns about Data

Since this isn't common to see on the Inventor Library, you might be concerned about what data is being sent to our own API. For full transparency, here is what and how often we're sending:

#### What data?

* Bot/Team Owner Discord User ID

#### How often?

* Every day
* User triggered (Pro Check Slash Command)

#### Data Fourthwall Stores

Fourthwall stores some data when you create an account on the InvenTutor Shop.

#### Data we can see from Fourthwall:

* Store Account Username
* Store Account Profile Picture
* Membership Status
* Store Account E-mail
* Joined Date
* Join Method

:::info
We do **not** track how often our API is triggered.
