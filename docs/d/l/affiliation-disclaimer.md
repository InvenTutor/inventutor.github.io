# Affiliation Disclaimer

Welcome to **InvenTutor** – a community-created platform dedicated to helping users learn and master **Inventor.gg** through high-quality tutorials, guides, and educational resources.

We want to be 100% transparent with our users:

> **InvenTutor is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to Inventor.gg or its creators in any way.**

### Why This Matters

We believe it's important to clearly separate our platform and purpose from that of Inventor.gg. While we deeply respect the work being done by the Inventor.gg team and are enthusiastic users of their platform, **InvenTutor is an independent service** built by fans, educators, and developers who want to support the broader Inventor.gg community.

Our goal is to:

* Help new users learn how to use Inventor.gg more effectively
* Offer tutorials, walkthroughs, and best practices
* Showcase community-made projects and tips
* Provide learning resources in a structured and beginner-friendly way

### Trademark & Brand Clarification

“**Inventor.gg**” is a trademark owned by its respective creators or organization. Any references to it are made solely for descriptive or educational purposes. **We do not claim any ownership of the Inventor.gg name, logo, or intellectual property.**

### Our Commitment to Integrity

We created InvenTutor because we genuinely love using Inventor.gg and want to help others unlock its potential. But we also recognize the importance of respecting the original creators, their intellectual property, and their community guidelines.

That’s why:

* We never misrepresent ourselves as the official Inventor.gg resource.
* We provide clear attribution where appropriate.

### Final Thoughts

Our mission at InvenTutor is simple: **make learning Inventor.gg easier, faster, and more accessible.** We’re fans helping fans, not an official extension of the product.

Thank you for using InvenTutor, and thank you to the Inventor.gg team for creating such an inspiring platform.
