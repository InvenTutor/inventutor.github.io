## How Plugin Features Are Enabled
Once a membership is active and linked to your Discord account, plugins will detect your status and enable additional features accordingly. This process is automatic and tied to the botâ€™s ownership:

- Solo bots check the **bot owner's** Discord ID.
- Team bots check the **team ownerâ€™s** Discord ID.

You can verify status using a built-in Pro Check command.

## Transparency & Data Handling
We value privacy and transparency. Here's what data is used for Pro access checks:

### Data Sent to Our API
- Discord User ID of the bot/team owner

### Frequency
- Daily background check
- On-demand check (via user interaction)

### Data Visible to Us via Membership Platform
- Account username and avatar
- Membership status
- Email address
- Join date and method

:::info
We do **not** track plugin usage frequency or user behavior.

## Note on Access Philosophy
We believe core functionality should be free. InvenTutor Pro only unlocks optional enhancements that improve the user experience, such as premium UI elements or cosmetic features. No core plugin features are locked behind the membership.
